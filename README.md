# 'Hello... Purgatory'

Escape tutorial hell. Stop just reading tutorials and create your own. Let others collaborate on it and see what the hell you can build. You're ready, so do it. Deeeeew iiiiiit!

So, you've started learning [insert language/library/framework/tool/whatever]. Love it! Scenario: You've been learning your particular thing for some time now, so you know things and stuff. Many times the hardest part is transitiong from this learning phase to a DOING phase. Like creating that thing from the stuff you learned, which is the reason you started learning in the first place. Before you know it the question becomes 'Where can I find a tutorial to start creating with...'. This is tutorial hell.

In this particular case, you're on your own. The whole purpose of this repository is to get you building. You can continue your learning,but do it here through creating. If you want it, get feedback from other collaborators on your project. If not, just clone this repo and BUILD. Let it be your springboard into collaborating on other projects.
