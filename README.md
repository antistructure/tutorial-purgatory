# 'Hello... Purgatory'

So, you've started learning [*insert language/library/framework/tool/whatever*]. Love it! 

You've been learning your particular thing for some time now and following tutorials, so you know some things and stuff. Many times the hardest part is transitiong from this learning phase to a *doing* phase. Like creating that thing from the stuff you learned, which is the reason you started learning in the first place. Now your dependent on tutorials and following other peoples guides instead of creating on your own because you feel like you can't do it without one. Instead of the question being 'How can I...', it becomes 'Where can I find a tutorial for...'.

**This is tutorial hell**.

# Break Out and Ascend

Escape tutorial hell. Stop just reading tutorials and start creating. Let others collaborate on it and see what the hell you can build. You're ready, so do it. Deeeeew iiiiiit!

# Get Creating

The purpose of this repository is to get you building. You can continue your learning,but do it here through creating or *while* learning. Clone this repo and BUILD. Let it be your springboard into collaborating on other projects. This blank starter project is the only thing you're getting. Or, if it's developing into a project of it's own from different collaborators jump in! This is going to be a real-world project, but there will be no requirements to start collaborating and pull requests will always be given. Most importantly, have fun and realize how fun it can be. Who cares what anyone else thinks except for you.
